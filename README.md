Segmentation of White Blood Cells using Unsupervised Machine Learning Technique
### Use of K-Means Clustering with Morphological Operations 
## What is K-Means Clustering? 
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised Machine Learning Technique that uses the concept of euclidean/hamiltonian distance to separate and form 
clusters.

Now we would see how we are using K-Means Clustering for Nucleus Segmentation
## Step 1: Image extraction and showing
